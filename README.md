## What's that? 

This is yet another, open source, and very simple ODM for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).

Mapmon it's highly inspired in [Yamop](https://github.com/mawelous/yamop), but adapted to PHP.7 and the [new client for MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library)

It works like the standard MongoDB PHP extension interface but returns objects instead of arrays (as ODM).
